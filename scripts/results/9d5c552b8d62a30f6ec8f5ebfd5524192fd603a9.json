      "reason": "The changes refactor the MainWindow class, which may improve modularity and separation of concerns, aligning with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). However, without the full context of the MainWindow class and its previous implementation, it's challenging to assess the full impact on other SOLID principles. The refactoring might improve maintainability and testability, which are indirectly related to SOLID principles."
