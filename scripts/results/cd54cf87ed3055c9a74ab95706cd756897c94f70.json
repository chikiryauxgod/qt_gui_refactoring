      "reason": "The code changes do not significantly impact the SOLID principles. The changes are primarily related to bug fixes and minor code refactoring. The codebase maintains a reasonable level of cohesion and low coupling, which are key aspects of SOLID principles. However, there is room for improvement in adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open/Closed Principle (OCP) in some parts of the codebase."
