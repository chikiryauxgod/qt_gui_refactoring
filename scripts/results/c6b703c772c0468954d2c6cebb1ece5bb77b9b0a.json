      "reason": "The code changes do not significantly impact the SOLID principles. The addition of `AxisControlConfig` and the modification of `VideoStreamThread` do not introduce new dependencies or violate the Single Responsibility Principle. However, the code could benefit from better separation of concerns, particularly in how the `VideoStreamThread` handles video capture and frame processing."
