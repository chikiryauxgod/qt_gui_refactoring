      "solid_score": 8,
      "reason": "The code demonstrates good adherence to SOLID principles, particularly the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). The `VideoStreamThread` class is designed to be easily extendable by allowing the injection of different `FrameSource` and `FrameConverter` implementations. This promotes flexibility and reduces tight coupling. The use of interfaces (`FrameSource` and `FrameConverter`) adheres to the Dependency Inversion Principle by depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. However, there is room for improvement in the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) as the `VideoStreamThread` class handles both video processing and signal emission, which could be separated for better clarity. The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is also not fully utilized, as the `FrameSource` interface could be more strictly enforced to ensure that all implementations behave consistently."
