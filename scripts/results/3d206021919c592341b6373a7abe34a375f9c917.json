      "solid_score": 7,
      "reason": "The changes introduce a new feature (VideoStreamThread) and update the .gitignore file. The VideoStreamThread class follows the Single Responsibility Principle by handling video streaming tasks. However, the VideoStreamThread class could benefit from better error handling and logging, which would improve the robustness of the code. The .gitignore update is a minor change and does not significantly impact the SOLID principles."
