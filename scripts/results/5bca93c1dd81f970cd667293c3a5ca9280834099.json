      "reason": "The changes primarily involve renaming files and updating import statements, which do not significantly impact the code's structure or logic. The modifications are mostly about organization and naming conventions, which do not affect the SOLID principles directly. However, the renaming of files and modules could be seen as a form of refactoring that improves clarity and maintainability, which indirectly supports the Open/Closed Principle by making the codebase easier to extend and modify in the future."
