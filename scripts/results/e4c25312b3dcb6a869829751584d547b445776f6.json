      "reason": "The code does not adhere to SOLID principles. The class Electroerosion is tightly coupled with specific attributes and methods, and there is no clear separation of concerns. The class does not follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) as it handles both initialization and logging. Additionally, there is no dependency injection or inversion of control, which affects the Open/Closed Principle (OCP). The class is not easily extensible or modifiable without changing its internal structure."
