      "reason": "The code introduces a new class `Robot` with clear separation of responsibilities. It follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by encapsulating robot-related functionality. The class is designed to be extensible, allowing for future modifications without affecting other parts of the system, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP). The class does not currently exhibit issues related to the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), or Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) as it is a simple implementation. However, it is a good starting point for further development that could incorporate these principles."
