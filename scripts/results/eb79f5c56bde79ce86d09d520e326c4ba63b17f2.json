      "reason": "The code introduces a new class `Pico` with methods `pump_in` and `pump_out` that perform specific actions. While this code does not violate SOLID principles directly, it could be improved by ensuring that the `Pico` class adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and that its methods are flexible and open to extension. However, given the limited context, the code is well-structured for its purpose."
