      "reason": "The code introduces a new controller and presenter, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by separating concerns. The new code follows the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) as it is open for extension (new controllers can be added) but closed for modification. The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is respected as the RobotControllerPort interface is well-defined. The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is also followed as the presenter depends on the abstraction (RobotControllerPort) rather than a concrete implementation."
