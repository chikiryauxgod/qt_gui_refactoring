      "reason": "The changes primarily involve adding tests and refactoring test files, which do not directly impact the core application logic. The addition of tests is a good practice for ensuring the reliability of the codebase, but it does not directly address the SOLID principles in the application code itself. Therefore, the score reflects the positive impact of adding tests while acknowledging that the changes do not directly improve the SOLID principles in the application code."
