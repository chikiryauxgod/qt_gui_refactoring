      "solid_score": 8,
      "reason": "The code demonstrates good adherence to SOLID principles, particularly Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open/Closed Principle (OCP). The AxisControlConfig class has a single responsibility (configuration management) and is open for extension (can be extended with new parameters) without modification. The validation logic is well-structured and follows good design principles. The code could benefit from better separation of concerns by moving validation to a separate validator class, but overall the design is solid."
