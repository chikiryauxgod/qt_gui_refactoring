      "reason": "The code adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by having a dedicated class for executing joint trajectories. It also follows the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) as it can be extended with different trajectory services without modification. However, it lacks proper dependency injection and inversion of control, which could be improved for better testability and maintainability."
