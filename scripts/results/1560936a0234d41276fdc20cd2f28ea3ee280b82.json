      "reason": "The refactoring of extracting ApplicationState from MainWindow improves the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by separating concerns. The ApplicationState class now handles application state management, while MainWindow focuses on UI-related tasks. However, further improvements could be made to ensure that other SOLID principles are fully adhered to, such as ensuring Open/Closed Principle compliance in the future."
