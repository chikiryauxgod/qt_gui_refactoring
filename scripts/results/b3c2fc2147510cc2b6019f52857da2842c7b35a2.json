      "reason": "The changes introduce a new class `Arrow3DData` and a function `matplotlib_project` which encapsulate data and behavior related to 3D arrows. This improves modularity and separation of concerns. However, the `Arrow3D` class still tightly couples the 3D projection logic with the arrow rendering, which could be further decoupled for better adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle."
