      "reason": "The code introduces a new class structure that could be improved by applying SOLID principles. The `ErosionWorker` class could benefit from better separation of concerns and more explicit interfaces. The `ErosionController` and `GCodeProcessor` classes could be designed with more specific responsibilities. The `ErosionWorker` class could be refactored to better adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle by separating concerns related to thread management, progress tracking, and erosion control. The code could also benefit from better error handling and logging. The overall structure could be improved by applying the Dependency Inversion Principle to make the system more flexible and maintainable."
