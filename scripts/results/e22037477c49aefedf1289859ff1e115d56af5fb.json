      "solid_score": 8,
      "reason": "The changes introduce a new module `arrow3D` that follows good separation of concerns and encapsulation principles. The code is modularized into its own package, which adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). The new module is self-contained and does not depend on other parts of the codebase, which is a good practice for maintainability and testability. However, the introduction of a new module could be seen as a deviation from the existing codebase structure, which might be considered a violation of the principle of consistency in the codebase. This is a minor concern and does not significantly impact the overall design."
