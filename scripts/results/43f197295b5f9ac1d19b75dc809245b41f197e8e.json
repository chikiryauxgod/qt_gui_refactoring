      "solid_score": 8,
      "reason": "The code changes introduce a new presenter class `JointControlPresenter` and refactor the `JointTrajectoryExecutor` to use this presenter instead of directly calling the controller. This change adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by separating concerns: the presenter is responsible for setting joint positions, while the executor handles trajectory execution. The code also introduces a new test file for the presenter, which is a good practice for unit testing. However, the overall impact on the SOLID principles is moderate, as the changes are focused on refactoring and adding new components rather than a complete overhaul of the existing codebase."
