      "reason": "The code shows some adherence to SOLID principles, particularly Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open/Closed Principle (OCP), but lacks proper separation of concerns and extensibility. The Electroerosion class has too many responsibilities and the code is tightly coupled. The Pico and Robot classes could benefit from better abstraction and interface definitions."
