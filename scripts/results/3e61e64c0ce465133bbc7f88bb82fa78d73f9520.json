      "reason": "The code demonstrates good adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by having a dedicated service class for managing XYZ trajectory data. The class is focused solely on trajectory management without knowledge of UI components or controllers. However, there's room for improvement in documentation and potential addition of input validation. The code structure and naming conventions are clear and maintainable."
