      "solid_score": 7,
      "reason": "The changes made in the codebase show some adherence to SOLID principles, particularly in the refactoring of the `create_joints_trajectory_tab` method in `qt_interface.py`. The code now uses more structured layouts and better organization, which can be seen as a step towards better separation of concerns. However, there are still areas for improvement, such as ensuring that the code is more modular and that dependencies are properly managed. The changes made do not fully adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle, as some methods still have multiple responsibilities. Additionally, the code could benefit from better naming conventions and more consistent formatting."
