      "reason": "The changes made in the commit do not significantly impact the code structure or logic, which are the primary areas affected by the SOLID principles. The changes are related to import statements, which do not directly influence the Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, or Dependency Inversion Principle. However, the addition of a new import statement could be seen as a minor violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle if the new dependency introduces a tight coupling. Overall, the impact on the SOLID principles is minimal."
