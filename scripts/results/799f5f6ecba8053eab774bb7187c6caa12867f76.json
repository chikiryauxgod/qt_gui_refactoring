      "reason": "The code adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by having a single responsibility for logging. However, it lacks adherence to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) as it is not easily extendable for different logging mechanisms. It also does not violate the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), or Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) as there are no interfaces or inheritance involved in this simple implementation."
